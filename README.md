## What is Hazel  

Hazel is a smart macOS application designed to automate the way you handle files and folders. It continuously monitors selected folders, such as Downloads, Desktop, or Documents, and applies custom rules you set up, saving you valuable time.  

The app works silently in the background, automatically performing tasks like renaming files, moving them to specific folders, tagging, archiving, or even deleting them. Hazel helps maintain order on your Mac without requiring constant manual cleanup.  

Hazel is particularly useful for people who deal with a large number of files daily. For instance, it can organize photos into dated folders, automatically back up documents to external drives or cloud storage, or clean up your Downloads folder by removing old files you no longer need.  

In addition to basic automation, Hazel supports advanced workflows by integrating with AppleScript, Automator, and shell scripts. This means you can create complex actions tailored to your needs, whether for business, creative projects, or personal file management.  

By reducing repetitive tasks and keeping your Mac tidy, Hazel improves productivity and provides a smooth, optimized user experience. It’s the perfect tool for anyone who values efficiency and a clutter-free workspace.
